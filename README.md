Ruby Survival Games Collection
Overview
This repository contains three different versions of a survival-based Ruby game. Each version improves upon the previous one, adding new mechanics, enemies, and features. The goal of each game is to defeat all enemies and survive as long as possible!

Game Versions
1. Basic Combat Game (combat_non_interactif)
A simple turn-based battle between a two PokÃ©mons

2. Advanced Combat with Power-ups (combat_interactif)

The game includes a better combat system and improved enemy AI.

Players must strategize between attacking or healing.

3. Full-Featured Survival Game (Battle_Royale)
Introduces progressive enemy spawns instead of starting with all enemies at once.

More enemies join the battle over time, making survival harder.

Players can find better weapons, heal, and fight waves of enemies dynamically.
